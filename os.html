Open-source software development is the process by which open-source software, or similar software whose source code 
is publicly available, is developed by an open-source software project. These are software products available with its
source code under an open-source license to study, change, and improve its design. Examples of some popular open-source 
software products are Mozilla Firefox, Google Chromium, Android, LibreOffice and the VLC media player. 
Open-source software development has been a large part of the creation of the World Wide Web as we know it,
with Tim Berners-Lee contributing his HTML code development as the original platform upon which the internet is now built.
